::: comment
In the epilogue of "What is Life?" (p.86 ff.),
Erwin Schröder explores the questions of consciousness,
    of the *I*
    and of immortality
via a series of deductions
based on the assumption that 
    immediate experiences,
        though they carry a deceptive illusion,
    inevitably guide to the obvious answers to these questions.
:::

All events in the body, including those events corresponding to the mind, are happening in physical space and time.
As such, and as explained by Schrödinger in the previous chapters, these events are not fully deterministic,
but "statistico-deterministic",
i.e. made quasi-deterministic via the statistical scaling of non-deterministic quantum events.

Schrödinger stresses that *quantum indeterminacy* plays no biological role
except possibly in the randomization properties of meiosis and mutation on the level of genes.

::: comment
This note would, at least today, refer to the idea of quantum effects being at the root of consciousness and self-awareness.

Schröder states (actually assumes) that:

> Immediate experiences in themselves [...] are logically incapable of contradicting each other.
[@Schroedinger44, p.86]

He further states two premises:

1. *My* body abides the Laws of Nature.
2. *I* feel like *I* am in control over (some parts of) it, and thus *I* am responsible for its motions.

Schrödinger claims to draw the only possibly conclusion from these premises as such:

> [Therefore] I am the person, if any, who controls the 'motion of the atoms' according to the Laws of Nature.

He suggests that this is close to proving "God and immortality at one stroke": Deus factus sum (I have become God).

Schrödinger further states that:

> Consciousness is never experiences in the plural, only in the singular.

This experientally contradicts the idea of the *plurality of consciousnesses*,
i.e. the claim that there are multiple independent consciousnesses (e.g. *I* and *You*) out there.

Plurality hypothesis

:   The Widely accepted assumption of plurality of consciousnesses

For Schrödinger, the plurality hypothesis seems to derive from
the experience of consciousness always being tied to a physical state of matter (e.g. the body, the brain),
plus the natural observation of:

1. a plurality of different mind states (in there)
2. multiplied over of similar bodies (out there).

Therefore, a further natural consequence of the plurality hypothesis is the idea of the *soul*,
each tied to a *body*,
as there needs to be a substrate for the plurality of consciousnesses.

::: comment
In other words: the *soul* is what consciousness is under the assumption of a plurality of consciousnesses.
:::

So,
are *souls* immortal (contradicting the above assumptions from which the very idea of *souls* is derived)
or
are *souls* mortally tied to the body (less superstitious, but "distasteful" and "much greater nonsense")
?

Based on these deductions,
Schrödinger expresses a general suspicion of the plurality hypothesis.

He suggests an alternative: to respect the immediate experience of a *singular consciousness* with an unknown plurality
and observe that:

> [...] there is only one thing
> and that
>   what seems to be a plurality
> is merely a series of different aspects of this one thing,
> produced by a deception
> (the Indian MAYA);

Schrödinger likens this deception

- to a gallery of mirrors
- to a single mountain being confused with two different ones because it looks different depending on the valley from which one looks upon it
- to a tree reflecting different images of itself into different minds, none of whom experience the actual single tree itself.

It seems incontrovertible to *Me* that *My* experiences and memories form a complete unit that is distinct from other units.
This unit is referred to as *I*.

Schröder specifies the intuition of the *I* as

> the canvas *upon which* [experiences and memories] are collected.

This intuition becomes obvious on thorough introspection.

:::
The result of this experiment of introspection 
can more or less easily be replicated
through meditation, 
particularly mindfulness and Zen.
:::

For example,
the experiences and memories of a lifetime,
as they draw upon the momentary canvas of the *I*,
seem to produce different *I*s,
depending on the coherent units these experiences form.

As *my* life changes,
the *I* changes.
The *Me* from a past chapter of my life,
where my experiences where vastly different from today (e.g. by country, friends, etc.)
does not feel to be the same as *Me* today.

Schrödinger suggests that even a character in a book
that *I* am reading today
seems more like *Me*
than the *I* from *My* distant past.

Contradictory to the model of plurality (and its deduction of the *soul*),
a *death* has not been in between these different *I*s.

Following from these observations follows
that,
whatever the *I* is,
it cannot be contingent on experiences or memory,
nor be deducible from a naive feeling of what *I* am.
There is an illusory component to this feeling
that becomes obvious on closer introspection.

Whatever the *I* is
must transcend the ever-changing stream of experiences and memories:

> In no case is there a loss of personal existence to deplore.
> Nor will there ever be.

... hinting to a necessary immortality of the *I*.
