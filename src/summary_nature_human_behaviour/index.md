## Introduction

<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01443-2>

*Nature Human Behaviour* is a sub-journal of *Nature* that 
"publishes research [...] into any aspect of individual or collective human behaviour".
Its self-declared 
"mission is to strengthen the reach and impact of human behaviour research in directly addressing our most pressing social challenges".
For this aim, it draws publications from social sciences, natural sciences, life sciences and culture studies.

In this editorial published on August 18, 2022, called "Science must respect the dignity and rights of all humans",
the editors of the journal announce the future and retroactive censoring of scientific publications to the journal
to adhere to its contemporary moral guidelines.

As explained by the authors, 
these new guidelines serve the dogma of *Critical Constructivism*,
(also called *Critical Social Justice* or *Wokism* for short)

The following is a series of notable excerpts with my (mostly redundant) comments.
I shall lay out first-hand evidence to support the claim that *Nature*,
exemplary for probably most of the academy and its institutions,
has fallen prey to the religious fanaticism of Woke activists
and should no longer be trusted as a platform for any scientific work
by any self-respecting scientist.

I recommend reading this three-pager in total before reading below comments.

## Excerpts

First sentence:

> Although academic freedom is fundamental, it is not unbounded. 

The editors introduce a truism in preparation for a classic Woke motte-and-bailey move
^[See "The Vacuity of Postmodernist Methodology" by Nicholas Shackel, 2005, <https://philpapers.org/rec/SHATVO-2>]
.
Of course academic freedom cannot be totally unbounded.
For example, there is an endless amount of unethical medical experiments that should never be conducted.
However, such obvious violation of ethics is not what the editors will argue for in the following.

Irrelevant mottes, 
i.e. statements that are easy to defend, 
are peppered throughout the article,
e.g. generic commitments against various kinds of discrimination and so-called "harm".

I will refrain from documenting every instance of mottes and focus on the baileys, 
i.e. on the statements that are hard to defend.

> [...] research may — inadvertently — stigmatize individuals or human groups.
> [...]
> It may provide justification for undermining the human rights of specific groups
> [...]
> In some cases [...] potential harms to the populations studied may outweigh the benefit of publication.

The editors introduce the concept of misuse of scientific work.

> Academic content that undermines the dignity or rights of specific groups; 
> assumes that a human group is superior or inferior over another simply because of a social characteristic; 
> includes hate speech or denigrating images; or promotes privileged, exclusionary perspectives raises ethics concerns 
> that may require revisions or supersede the value of publication.

The authors try to provide a definition for problematic academic work.
Not that the definition is very vague and relies on underspecified terms, 
i.e. "hate speech" and "exclusionary perspectives".
The "value of the publication" is hard or impossible to gauge,
and thus whether it is superseded by the ethical concerns is left to interpretation.

> There is a fine balance between academic freedom and the protection of the dignity and rights of individuals and human groups.

The fineness of this balance is probably exaggerated.
No justification of this statement is given.

> Science has for too long been complicit in perpetuating structural inequalities and discrimination in society. 

Bold claim without any explanation.
Again, more akin to a mantra or intercession than to a statement of fact.

> Researchers should be free to pursue lines of inquiry and the communication of knowledge and ideas without fear of repression or censorship. 
> At the same time, they have the ethical obligation to uphold intellectual integrity 
> and avoid preventable harms that may arise in the course of research or its communication.

This is classic Woke rhetoric.
A series of naturally reasonable statements, 
followed by the use of a Woke crossover word ("harm") pointing to an activist interpretation of the whole paragraph.

Similarly, they continue to define "harm" with reasonable definitions (e.g. physical suffering)
before ending the paragraph on a Woke note:

> stigmatization of a vulnerable human group or potential use of the results of research for unintended purposes
> (e.g. [...] misuse of information to threaten public health)

Again, the word "potential" should start to ring a bell.
Since possible "misuses" of a given piece of information are just a function of the editors' creativity,
this argument is what shall give the editors basically unlimited censoring power.
Herein lies the magic trick.

Along similar lines, the US *Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency* recently defined
*malinformation* as "based on fact, but used out of context to mislead, harm, or manipulate".
^["Mis, Dis, Malinformation", <https://www.cisa.gov/mdm> (2022-08-29)]
This definition is officially used to identify speech as criminal (or worse, terroristic)
and should thus be assumed to feed into censorship programmes.

Doubling down on the notion of justified suppression of knowledge:

> Although the pursuit of knowledge is a fundamental public good, 
> considerations of harm can occasionally supersede the goal of seeking or sharing new knowledge, 
> and a decision not to undertake or not to publish a project may be warranted.

Still, the conditions of suppression are not explained except as contingent on undefined Woke gobbledigook:

> [...] authors should use inclusive, respectful, non-stigmatizing language in their submitted manuscripts. 

The intrusion of subjective feeling-based constraints into the domain of strictly objective scientific work could not be more striking.
It is as if the editors do not understand the process of harvesting hard facts from reality,
and that when it relies on subjective perspectives, something has gone wrong and the facts do not deserve the label "scientific".

Now, the question arises: 
Who shall make the final decisions on these subjective metrics?
Who measure the "harmfulness" of a given publication candidate?

Well, the editors of course:

> Consideration of risks and benefits (above and beyond any institutional ethics review) underlies the editorial process of all forms of scholarly communication in our publications. 
> Editors consider harms that might result from the publication of a piece of scholarly communication, 
> may seek external guidance on such potential risks of harm as part of the editorial process, 
> and in cases of substantial risk of harm that outweighs any potential benefits, 
> may **decline** publication (or **correct**, **retract**, **remove** or otherwise **amend** already published content).

(My emphasis.)

Note the emphasized terms.
The editors not only reserve themselves the right to decline publications based on their personal moral grandstanding reflexes,
but even to alter the record of existing publications, effectively changing history.

As a result, we, the readers, cannot be certain anymore of a number of things for any publication ever published in the journal:

- Is this publication original?
- Are there sentences or paragraphs missing or added?
- Are there sentences or paragraphs changed in wording?
- Has any of this been done by the original authors or the editors of the journal?

Again, a classic Woke tactic to undermine the institution it infects: spread confusion, uncertainty and ambiguity.

Repeated:

> [...] editors reserve the right to request modifications to 
> (or correct or otherwise amend post-publication), 
> and in severe cases refuse publication of (or retract post-publication)

What follows are the 4 criteria that induce editorial censorship (with my emphasis):

> 1. Content that is **premised upon the assumption** of inherent biological, social, 
>    or cultural superiority or inferiority of one human group over another based on 
>    race, ethnicity, national or social origin, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, political or other beliefs, age, disease, (dis)ability, or other socially constructed or socially relevant groupings 
>    (hereafter referred to as socially constructed or socially relevant human groupings).
> 
> 2. Content that undermines — **or could reasonably be perceived to undermine** — 
>    the rights and **dignities** of an individual or human group 
>    on the basis of socially constructed or socially relevant human groupings.
> 
> 3. Content that includes text or images 
>    that directly or indirectly **disparage a person or group** 
>    on the basis of socially constructed or socially relevant human groupings.
> 
> 4. Submissions that embody **singular, privileged perspectives**, 
>    which are **exclusionary of a diversity** of voices 
>    in relation to socially constructed or socially relevant human groupings, 
>    and which **purport such perspectives to be generalisable and/or assumed**.

All emphasized terms are subject to the editors' (and only the editors') interpretation.
None of these terms lends itself to a civilized argument.
It is, in their words, a matter of personal perspective and lived experience
to decided if a publication crosses the threshold of harmfulness.

What follows is a barrage of intrusions into the work of proper scientists.
A notable example:

> Race and ethnicity are sociopolitical constructs. 
> Humans do not have biological races, 
> at least based on modern biological criteria for the identification of geographical races or subspecies.

Precisely a question for the validity of this statement could be the subject of new studies.
The fact that they explicitly exclude this question from being asked is nothing less than unscientific authoritarianism.

The section continues in this manner by prescribing the way "proper" science shall be done around these so-called constructs.


## Conclusion

*Nature Human Behaviour*, and by extension *Nature*, has officially jumped the shark.

Unit this very editorial is retracted, publications in this journal should be taken with a grain of salt,
especially when they concern the topics deemed sensitive by the editors.

Most worrying is the audacity of imposing quite arbitrary quasi-religious morals and, frankly, delusions onto the work of proper scientists.
As this has become the norm throughout universities and academic branches (with few exceptions), this editorial comes to no surprise.
