The following is a selective & commented summary of 
"What is Life?" by Erwin Schrödinger (1944), 
a classical physicist's take on what biological life is in its essence.

## Chapter 1: The Classical Physicist's approach to the subject

DNA is an *aperiodic crystal*.
The difference between a periodic crystal and an aperiodic crystal is analogous to the difference between a wallpaper and a piece of embroidery.

Why are atoms so small?
This question is better asked as: why am I so large?

Answer:

> The working of an organism requires exact physical laws[.]

Only a brain incapable of being affected by the disorderly effects of single atoms
(i.e. incapable of sensing single atoms)
possesses the necessary high-level order to contemplate the idea of an atom.

::: comment
This insight is related to the resolution of another intuitive confusion:

Are we not incredibly lucky to inhabit one of very few inhabitable planets in our galaxy or even the universe? 
Is it not a coincidence that our planet possesses all the incredibly rare features to evolve life?

No, because there is no other planet we could have been alive on.
The fact that we are able to contemplate this apparent coincidence is contingent on our planet being unique among many.

Thought itself is

1. an orderly thing 
2. can only be applied to things with a certain degree on orderliness.

Therefore the following conditions apply for thought to exist:

1. The substrate of thought (i.e. a brain) must be of high order. Its organization must obey laws, i.e. it must be accurate and predictable.
2. The same condition applies to the perceptions and interactions between that substrate and its objects.

These conditions are not satisfied on the atomic scale because of *disorderly heat motion* (**Brownian Movement**):

> Physical laws rest on atomic statistics and are therefore only approximate[.]
> [...]
> Their precision is based on the large number of atoms intervening[.]

Examples of phenomena where Brownian Movement causes observable unpredictability:

- Paramagnetism
- Diffusion
- Measurement via light pendulum

**The $\sqrt{n}$ rule**:

> The laws of physics and physical chemistry are inaccurate within a probable relative error of the order of
> $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$,
> where $n$ is the number of molecules that co-operate to bring about that law.

Therefore, a biological system must be composed of a large number of particles ($n$) in order to benefit from accurate laws.


## Chapter 2: The Hereditary Mechanism

Question: If the $\sqrt{n}$ rule applies, then how can low-$n$ DNA determine an organism with perfect accuracy?

Def. organism: A biological system exhibiting a four-dimensional pattern (incl. ontogenesis).

---

The author summarizes the statistical properties of the distribution of hereditary information during mitosis and meiosis.
From this statistical perspective (derived from experiments), the author reasons about a "hypothetical material carrier of a definite hereditary feature" (the gene) without knowing about its chemical properties.

::: comment
Caveat: In fact, at the time of writing (1944), the double helix structure of DNA was still unknown.
It was discovered 1953 by American biologist James Watson and English physicist Francis Crick.

The author works like a true physicist: calculate his way down to unobservable phenomena and describe them on a functional level without making any assumptions about the particular material substrate.
Quantum mechanics works the same way: we do not know what particles *are*, but we know what they *do*.
:::

This hypothetical "gene" is estimated to contain a few million atoms at most.
This number $n$ is too small to satisfy the $\sqrt{n}$ rule of orderliness.

However, the code expressed by the gene is known to produce the accurate and (hypothetically) predictable high-level four-dimensional patterns of an organism across generations.

How can this high degree of *orderliness* and *permanence* emerge from a material carrier that does not satisfy the $\sqrt{n}$ rule of statistical physics?

> [...] reconcile the high durability if the hereditary substance with its minute size [...] [@Schroedinger44, p.68]


## Chapter 3: Mutations

The author summarises how the hereditary mechanism works.

---

Mutations must be rare events in order for natural selection to work.
Else, as most mutations are detrimental to the phenotype, good mutations would mostly be weeded out along with the bad mutations in the same organism:

> [...] in order to ascertain whether the innovations improve or decrease the output,
> it is essential that they should be introduced one at a time,
> while all the other parts of the mechanism are kept constant [@Schroedinger44, p.42]

::: comment
This seems unlikely. At least in its most extreme interpretation (one single mutation at a time).

Complex systems, such as organisms, are characterized by complex synergies, nonlinear dynamics and positive/negative feedback loops.
It seems unlikely that a mutation scheme that ignores these properties would suffice for adaptive evolution.

This is usually the case:

- One gene effects many phenotypical properties.
- One phenotypical property is affected by many genes.

This indicates a complex web of synergies between the genes.

A single mutation would hardly be expected to yield a selectable improvement,
let alone improvements on all (or most of) the affected phenotypical properties
-- especially on a protein-coding gene, and especially when the mutation shifts the codon window (insertion, deletion) and thus changes the whole sequence of amino acids to a completely different protein structure.

It seems necessary to orchestrate several mutations at once for a better phenotype to arise.
This would contradict the statement by the author.

## Chapter 4: The Quantum-Mechanical Evidence

The author contemplates the question of how DNA information can be stable across generations despite the perturbing effect of Brownian movement on the molecular level.

::: comment
The author assumes a very small number of atoms per DNA molecule ("on the order of 1000 or less") which makes the question even more striking.

In fact, a base pair contains about two dozen atoms (by my own count by example of the A-T pair).
The human genome contains 3,117,275,501 base pairs (see <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_009914755.1/#/st>)
We are therefore looking at about 70 billion atoms per human genome.

Nevertheless, his point should still stand.
A single gene may contain atoms on the order of 1000 atoms and still retains the property of permanence.
:::

A given organic molecule tends to show up in different isomeric arrangements.
Each arrangement is energetically stable, i.e. it cannot transform into a different arrangement without investment of energy.

The DNA molecule facilitates its encoding power in a similar way: it comes in different isomeric arrangements of the same atoms.

::: comment
The analogy is close to correct.

DNA does not encode information via isomeric variants of the same atoms.
But one could possibly say that the encoding happens via 
"isomeric variants of base pairs",
or "isomeric variants of a long series of different base pairs".

This analogy explains the author's earlier hypothesis that mutations would occur only one at a time.
This is clearly implausible from today's knowledge about the structure and function of DNA **until** you change the definition of "mutation" from "letter change at one position" to "change in isomeric configuration of the whole genome".
A mutation, in the author's view, would then be an isomeric reconfiguration of the DNA yielding a single phenotypical difference, not many phenotypical differences at a time.
:::

Each isomeric arrangement ist energetically stable, for the same reason that other organic isomers are energetically stable.

A mutation is then a high-energy event pushing the molecule from one isomer to the other.


## Chapter 5: Delbrück's Model Discussed and Tested

::: comment
The author hypothesises that a small vocabulary of letters make up the genetic code because.
Very few letters would suffice for a large number of isomeric variants of the genetic code.

Indeed, DNA is encoded by only 4 bases.

## Chapter 6: Order, Disorder and Entropy

> Life seems to be orderly and lawful behaviour of matter,
> not based exclusively on its tendency to go over from order to disorder,
> but based partly on existing order that is kept up. [@Schroedinger44, p.68]

> The living organism seems to be a macroscopic system
> which in part of its behaviour approaches to that purely mechanical (as contrasted with thermodynamical) conduct
> to which all systems tend, as the temperature approaches the absolute zero and the molecular disorder is removed.

::: comment
The "part of its behaviour" seems to refer to the expression of DNA.
:::

All "dead" things tend to some maximal entropic state in relation to its environment (equilibrium): no motion, no temperature difference, no electric differentials, etc.

*Metabolism* is the means by which a thing avoids decay into equilibrium.

> Everything that is going on in Nature means an increase of the entropy of the part of the world where it is going on. [@Schroedinger44, p.71]

This includes living organisms.
It continually produces **positive entropy** (decays into thermodynamical equilibrium with its environment) until death (maximum entropy)
unless it continually draws **negative entropy** (orderliness) from its environment.

Food is negative entropy.

What is entropy?

$$
entropy = \frac{\text{calories of heat added to the system}}{\text{absolute temperature at which the heat was supplied}}
$$

$$
entropy = k \log D
$$

- $k = 3.2983*10^{-24} \frac{cal.}{C}$ (Boltzmann constant)
- $D$: quantitative measure of atomistic disorder of the body in question

> That we give off heat is not accidental, but essential.
> For this is precisely the manner in which we dispose of the surplus entropy we continually produce in our physical life process. [@Schroedinger44, p.74]


## Is Life Based in the Laws of Physics?

> We witness the event that existing order displays the power of maintaining itself and of producing orderly events. [@Schroedinger44, p.77]

A situation only observed in living matter: the guiding principle (genome) in every cell is encoded in a single molecule (DNA), 
and it produces most orderly events in a regular and lawful manner.

This is what differentiates biology from physics and chemistry where orderliness only arises on the average, not in particular.

Two mechanisms of producing orderly events:

1. Order from disorder via a statistical mechanism
2. Order from order via ?
