WORK IN PROGRESS

Phylogeny

:   The evolutionary history of the development of a species or taxonomic group of organism
    ^[<https://www.biologyonline.com/dictionary/phylogeny>]
    Phylogenetic relationships are derived from molecular sequencing analyses of genes and proteins,
    or, historically, from morphological analyses.

    The data structure used to model phylogenetic relationships of eukaryotes is the *tree*.
    Prokaryotes require a graph to account for *horizontal gene transfer*.

Cladistics

:   A system of classification of organisms based on their similarities and differences in traits.

Taxon

:   A group of organisms defined by some characteristic.
    ^[<https://www.biologyonline.com/dictionary/taxon>]

    Examples: 

    - All red flowers
    - All airborne animals
    - All members of the genus *Canis*

Clade

:   A monophyletic taxon,
    i.e. a kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus or species.
    ^[<https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/17590/what-is-the-difference-between-these-terms-clade-monophyletic-group-and-taxon>]

    Example: Wolves and dogs are members of the same genus *Canis*.

Monophyletic group

:   A group of organisms is *monophyletic*
    if it 
    includes its most recent common ancestor
    and all descendants of that ancestor.

    Example: Birds

Paraphyletic group

:   A group of organisms is *paraphyletic* 
    if it 
    includes its most recent common ancestor
    but does **not** include some descendants of that ancestor.
    ^[<https://fossil.fandom.com/wiki/Paraphyly>]

    Example: Reptiles (excludes birds)

Polyphyletic group

:   A group of organisms is *polyphyletic*
    if it 
    does **not** include its most recent common ancestor.

    Example: Warm-blooded animals (includes mammals and birds, excludes all other amniota)

Apomorphy

:   A character state 
    - shared by organisms of **one taxon** 
    - derived from **their most recent** common ancestor

    Etymology: *apo* (away from) + *morph* (shape)

Synapomorphy

:   A character state
    - shared by organisms of **two taxa**
    - derived from **their most recent** common ancestor 
    - implies homology

    The ancestor itself possesses this trait as an *apomorphy*.

    Etymology: *syn* (together with) + *apo* (away from) + *morph* (shape)

    Example: All snake species share the trait of having lost their legs from a common ancestor which still had legs.

Plesiomorphy

:   A character state
- shared by organisms of **one or more** taxa
- inherited by **some** common ancestor
- not present in all descendants of that ancestor
^[<https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/plesiomorphy>]

    Example: Spines are a plesiomorphic trait of zebras and chimpanzess
    because it is homologous but not unique to these species.

Symplesiomorphy

:   A character state
    - shared by organisms of **two or more** taxa
    - that has been inherited by **some** common ancestor

Autapomorphy

:   A trait (or lack thereof)
    that has been innovated by organisms of one taxon.

Homoplasy

:   A character state
    that has been innovated independently by two or more species from different lineages,
    often as a result of evolutionary convergence.
    ^[<https://www.biologyonline.com/dictionary/homoplasy>]

    Etymology: *hom√≥s* (one and the same) + *plasis* (moulding)

    Example: Wings of bats and birds.
