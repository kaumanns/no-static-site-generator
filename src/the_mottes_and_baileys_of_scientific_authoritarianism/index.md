## Introduction: how merging facts and values rewires the scientific process

### On the inversion of control

Every machine requires a controller
.

In fact, this is what a *machine* is: 
    That soul-less entity on whose *consistency*, *precision*, *replicability* and *impartiality* can be relied upon, 
        irrespective of the application of its output 
        -- be it "good" or "bad" --
        and which hence requires a guiding hand to pull the lever and direct or stop its motion
.

In case of a machinery of systems or processes,
    this guiding hand is called *principles* or *values*
.
The processes are constrained or directed by a set of given values
    -- necessarily provided from outside the system that is to be supervised
.

For example, the machinery may be the editorial processes of a scientific journal
.
The editors may employ the value of *strict impartiality* 
    and reject submissions whose authors are subject to conflicts of interest
.

But what if we make the values themselves **a function of the output of the machine that they are supposed to control**,
    effectively **short-circuiting** the entire logic of supervision
?

If the machinery is a *complex system* [@Ladyman2013],
    such a short-circuit generates selective pressures favouring the instantiation of values that 
        support the interests of the system,
    especially its interests of **self-preservation** mediated by **growth** and **power**
.
This precisely inverts the principle of control:
    The puppet becomes its own master
.

### When academia becomes the master of values

Understand the production of objective truths (known as "science") as such a *complex* social process,
    particularly the institutions that form the administrative apparatus of scientific research:
        universities, conferences, peer-review, journals, etc.
.

In order to assume total control over itself, independent of external principles and values,
    an academic institution now just has to convey a simple idea:
        that science itself, through its inherent objectivity, can and must **guide itself** by its own principles and values,
        and no external supervision is necessary
.
This is the inversion of control.
And of course, the resulting principles and values are **exportable** to the world outside.

We are then coerced to wonder:

- Is what is **true** always **right**?
- Can we trust the scientific apparatus to assume such a role of **ethical authority**?
- If so, **who gets to decide** the terms and conditions of this grand unification of facts and virtue?
- How will this **short-circuited complex system** itself develop? Can it stay uncorrupted?
- **Would** all this not make the academic institutions some kind of **church**?

### On the separation of church and state

C. S. Lewis,
    a British writer and Anglican lay theologian (1898--1963),
    ^["C. S. Lewis", Wikipedia.org, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis> (2022-09-04)]
contemplated:

> Now I dread specialists in power because they are specialists speaking outside their special subjects. Let scientists tell us about sciences. But government involves questions about the good for man, and justice, and what things are worth having at what price; and on these a scientific training gives a man's opinion no added value. Let the doctor tell me I shall die unless I do so-and-so; but whether life is worth having on those terms is no more a question for him than for any other man.
^["Willing Slaves of the Welfare State -- Is Progress Possible?", C. S. Lewis, 1958, <http://liberty-tree.ca/research/willing_slaves_of_the_welfare_state> (2022-09-04)]

Quite the same worry has long been engraved into the Christian Bible.
The figure of Jesus is quoted to have said:

> Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's [Matthew 22:21]
^[Matthew 22:21, BibleGateway, <https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A21&version=NRSVUE> (2022-09-04)]

... effectively expressing the ethical necessity of a separation of church and state.


### The ethics of a journal

No better evidence for this necessity could have been given than
    a publication of the editors of *Nature Human Behaviour*
        on August 18, 2022,
    declaring their new (so-called) ethical guidelines and scopes of editorial authority:

<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01443-2>
[@NatureHumanBehaviour2022]

*Nature Human Behaviour* is a sub-journal of *Nature* that 

> publishes research [...] into any aspect of individual or collective human behaviour.
> [@NatureHumanBehaviour2022b]

Its self-declared mission is 

> to strengthen the reach and impact of human behaviour research in directly addressing our most pressing social challenges.
> [@NatureHumanBehaviour2022b]

For this aim, 
    the journal draws publications from social sciences, natural sciences, life sciences and culture studies.

For these domains of research, 
    the new guidance defends
        the **future and retroactive censoring of scientific publications**
        according to the doctrine of *Critical Social Justice*,
            also called *Wokism* as employed by the *Woke* [@Lindsay2022CriticalTheory]
.

The official justification for these new filter rules relies on the claim that 
    these ethics are based on a **given set of truths** 
        which are declared **immutable** from now on.
Furthermore, a gaslighting claim is made that the new filter rules actually **serve** the scientific process
    by excluding "hateful" perspectives 
        (which are "false" by definition)
    before they can do "harm"
        (as then defined by the authors)
.

Here,
        as C. S. Lewis predicted, 
    we witness the dogma of a rising new morality 
        dressing up in the clothes of a scientific institution
.

Much of this is exemplary for the general authoritarian drift in Western academia
.


### The grand unification and True and Right

In the following write-up,
    I shall extract the actual claims being made in the editorial,
        undressed from the confusion generated by pairs of *Motte-and-Bailey* argumentation
.
I shall thus provide evidence to support the claim that 
    the journal *Nature Human Behaviour*,
            (and by extension, *Nature*),
        at least pretends to adhere to the religious fanaticism of the Woke
            [@Lindsay2022Woke]
        in order to assume authority over what shall be said and, therefore, what shall be known
.

Since *Nature* is one of (if not the) most prestigious journals of the natural sciences,
    this attempt should be interpreted as an authoritarian assault on truth itself
    by merging the arbiters of facts and values
.
As a consequence,
    *Nature Human Behaviour*,
        and by extension *Nature*,
    should no longer be trusted as a platform for any scientific work
        by any scientist with a sense of integrity
.


## What is a *Motte-and-Bailey* argument?

In the very first sentence of the editorial,
    the authors introduce a truism
:

> Although academic freedom is fundamental, it is not unbounded. 

It is hard to disagree with this statement.
Of course, some academic endeavours cannot be allowed.
For instance,
    one can come up with an endless amount of obviously unethical medical experiments
.

So what is the point of stating an idea
    that no one could sensibly disagree with?

Truisms are often used by Woke activists to back up controversial claims that are hard or impossible to defend
.
This rhetorical move is generally known as a *Motte-and-Bailey* argument
    [@Shackel2005]
    ,
    a particular trick of sophist confusion intended to convince someone of a controversial idea without delivering valid arguments
.

A *motte* is a fortified tower 
    from which its vulnerable *bailey* (the unfortified area around it) is defended against attackers
.
Analogously, a *motte argument* is an easy-to-defend argument (e.g. a truism)
    that serves as a retreat for when the *bailey argument*,
        a controversial -- often plainly false -- and thus vulnerable claim, is threatened by valid criticism
.

For instance,
    a claim for total government surveillance of private communications 
        invites obvious criticism regarding its effects on the freedom of speech
.
A safe retreat against attacks on this claim could be
    the assertion that the protection of vulnerable groups requires effective strategies,
    or just stressing the general importance of public safety
.

It is important to notice that just because an argument is delivered via a *Motte-and-Bailey* move,
    it does not necessarily mean that the argument is invalid
.
However, arguments that are well-fortified with valid reasons do not require a *motte* backup
.
Therefore, *Motte-and-Bailey* moves can usually be viewed as an attempt to hide the controversial nature of an idea
.

As we will see,
    the ideas stated in this editorial are of such a nature
.
And as expected, *mottes* are used throughout to hide them
.


## The core *bailey* of the editorial

The overarching point of the editorial is that
    **scientific work must be constrained and censored**
    according to its **potential effects** on 
            -- what the editors call -- 
        "dignity and rights".
Much of the editorial is concerned with
        hiding this controversial statement under a set of *mottes* (as explained above)
.

The argumentation is based on a seductive fallacy:
The authors blur the line between 
    the impact of scientific work 
        on the **concrete participants** of experiments
    and 
        on the general group of **people about whom** the experiments aims to derive insights
.

This speculative group is used as the proxy for *victimhood*, 
    as commonly utilized by Woke reasoning
.
^[I found it surprising that the effects on the readers of the journal are not deemed relevant to push the argument. Not that I wished.]

For instance,
    an experiment may aim to cast light on the question of 
        how sex correlates with the ability to manipulate imaginary spatial objects in the mind
.
While there are actual participants in a corresponding experiment,
        likely unharmed,
    the editors may claim that
            there is potential harm effected onto persons of one or either of the sexes,
        e.g. via a potentiality of misinterpretation of the work that the derived insights would implicitly render one sex inferior.
    This potentiality should then inform the decision 
        whether the results should be published
        (and by extension the judgement of whether the research should have been conducted in the first place)
.

In short, the authors map properties of
        **objective verifiable harm** 
            with known external causes
    to
        **subjective potential harm**
            caused or modulated by misinterpretations or personal neuroses
.
This fallacious mapping is dishonestly framed as 
    "direct harm" versus "indirect harm"
    before it is cast as the editorial's central *bailey* line of confusion
.

Based on this apparent dishonesty,
    intentionality on behalf of the authors should be assumed.



## Mottes & Baileys of each section in the editorial

The following sections organize excerpts from the editorial (in chronological order)
    along the framework of a *Motte-and-Bailey* style of reasoning respectively
.
I give some short comments 
    highlighting certain salient linguistic features,
    and referring to related concepts, work and articles
.
I hope to clarify the insidiousness of the linguistic manipulations employed by the editors
.

I left out content from the original article 
    that I deemed irrelevant or fluff
.
Please refer to the original article
.


### Section: Introduction 

Motte:

> For example, research **may** — inadvertently — stigmatize individuals or human groups. It **may** be discriminatory, racist, sexist, ableist or homophobic. It **may** provide justification for undermining the human rights of specific groups, simply because of their social characteristics.

The modifier "may" (my emphasis) softens what would otherwise be a bailey.

The various facets of bigotry listed 
    have long been overloaded by the Woke with various contradictory meanings
.
Hence, in this context, they are left underspecified
-- likely intentionally, serving the motte
.

---

Motte:

> In this guidance, we urge authors to be respectful of the dignity and rights of the human groups they study.

Bailey:

> We encourage researchers to consider the potential implications of research on human groups defined on the basis of social characteristics; to be **reflective of their authorial perspective if not part of the group under study**;

The emphasized part (my emphasis) refers to the *Critical Theory* idea of *Standpoint Epistomology*
[@Lindsay2022SJEStandpointEpistemology]
^["Feminist Epistemology and Philosophy of Science", Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2020 <https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-epistemology/#FemiStanTheo> (2022-09-04)]

Motte:

> and to contextualise their findings to minimize as much as possible potential misuse or risks of harm to the studied groups in the public sphere. We also highlight the importance of respectful, non-stigmatizing language to avoid perpetuating stereotypes and causing harm to individuals and groups.

Noteable: A bailey wrapped between two mottes form this paragraph.

---

Motte: 

> Advancing knowledge and understanding is a fundamental public good. **In some cases**, however, potential harms to the populations studied **may** outweigh the benefit of publication.

The motte'ing modifiers "in some cases" and "may" 
    without which the second sentence would be clear bailey.

Bailey:

> Academic content that undermines the dignity or rights of specific groups; assumes that a human group is superior or inferior over another simply because of a social characteristic; includes hate speech or denigrating images; or promotes privileged, exclusionary perspectives raises ethics concerns that may require revisions or supersede the value of publication.

---

Motte/Bailey:

> There is a fine balance between academic freedom and the protection of the dignity and rights of individuals and human groups.

A "why not" statement. 
It is unclear what a "fine balance" is, so there is still a soft controversial aspect to this statement.

Bailey:

> Ensuring that ethically conducted research on individual differences and differences among human groups flourishes, and no research is discouraged simply because it may be socially or academically controversial, is as important as preventing harm.

Controversial when taking their new subjective and underspecified definition of "harm" into account.

Bailey:

> Science has for too long been **complicit** in **perpetuating** **structural inequalities** and **discrimination** in society.

"for too long" is the bailey part.
Else, this statement is washed out with overloaded Woke crossover words [@Pincourt2021, p. 23] (my emphasis) fading out into a vague motte.

It is actually surprising they would end the introduction on a high Woke note.
I would have expected them to finish with a clear motte.

### Section: "Principles of scholarly freedom and scholarly responsibility"

This sections serves to deliver just a single large motte:

> Researchers should be free to pursue lines of inquiry and the communication of knowledge and ideas without fear of repression or censorship. At the same time, they have the ethical obligation to uphold intellectual integrity and **avoid** preventable harms that may arise in the course of research or its communication.

Note: Modifier "avoid" (emphasis by me) renders the following statement hard to argue with.

### Section: "Benefits and harms of research"

Motte:

> Research should respect the dignity and rights of human research participants; of individuals or groups connected either with the research participants or the research topic; and of the communities in which research is carried out. Research should also respect the rights of non-human life, tangible and intangible heritage, natural resources, and the environment.

Arguing against basic "respect" is well an uphill battle,
    though it is left unspecified how that respect would manifest in the actual research.

Let's see if this clears up.

---

Motte:

> Harms can arise as a direct result of the conduct of research — for instance, injury to human participants in the course of participating in a research project; unnecessary suffering of non-human animals as a result of experimentation; material compromise of tangible heritage; ecosystem disruption etc. 

Bailey:

> Harms can also arise indirectly, as a result of the publication of a research project or a piece of scholarly communication – for instance, stigmatization of a vulnerable human group or potential use of the results of research for unintended purposes (e.g., public policies that undermine human rights or misuse of information to threaten public health).

This motte-and-bailey pair is 
    the heart of the editorial's argument.
The editors frame the dichotomy of "harms" as "direct" vs "indirect",
    which is intellectually dishonest at best.

This artificial distinction distracts from the more relevant features of two quite distinct kinds of "harms": a *motte* harm and a *bailey* harm.

As the authors themselves extrinsically define these two concepts,
        the *motte* harm is **objective** and **verifiable** (has manifested or will definitely manifest),
    while
        the *bailey* harm is **subjective** and **potential** (may manifest),
            including by a misinterpretation ("misuse") of the work
.

As interpretations go, 
    they have a substantial subjective component to them,
    making the prediction of an interpretation
        (never mind a *potential* one)
    highly speculative
.
This is where the authors prepare the reader to
    accept their authoritative estimation of the likelihood of the *bailey* harm,
    which is the whole point of this retorical confusion
.

**Sidenote 1**: Along similar lines, 
    the US *Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency* defined
        *malinformation* as "based on fact, but used out of context to mislead, harm, or manipulate"
.
    ^["Mis, Dis, Malinformation", 2022-02, <https://www.cisa.gov/mdm> (2022-08-29)]
This definition is officially used to identify speech as criminal (or worse, terroristic)
    and should thus be assumed to feed into censorship programmes
.

**Sidenote 2**: Repeatedly stressing the importance of "potentialities" suspiciously reflects one of the core religious tenants of the weird occultism of *Queer Theory*
^[*Queer Theory*, in short, is a branch in the family tree of so-called *Critical Theories*.].
These tenants, thoroughly spiritual in nature, are best illustrated with direct quotes from accredited literature of the Theory (my emphases):

> Queer is by definition whatever is **at odds with the normal**, the legitimate, the dominant. **There is nothing in particular to which it necessarily refers.** It is an **identity without an essence**. ‘Queer’ then, demarcates not a positivity but a positionality vis-à-vis the normative … [Queer] describes a **horizon of possibility** whose precise extent and heterogeneous scope **cannot in principle be delimited in advance**.

*David M. Halperin: Saint Foucault: Toward a Gay Hagiography. Oxford University Press, Oxford 1995, p. 62.*

> QUEERNESS **IS NOT yet here**. Queerness is an **ideality**. Put another way, **we are not yet queer**. We may never touch queerness, but we can feel it as the **warm illumination of a horizon imbued with potentiality**.

*José Esteban Muñoz: Cusing Utopia. The Then and There of Queer Futurity. New York University Press, New York 2009, p. 1.*

> If the term „queer“ is to be a site of collective contestation, the **point of departure** for a set of historical reflections and **futural imaginings**, it will have to remain that which is, in the present, never fully owned, but always and only redeployed, twisted, queered from a prior usage and in the direction of urgent and expanding political purposes.

*Judith Butler: Bodies that matter. Routledge, New York 1993, p. 228.*

Of course this would imply that the editors are, to some degree, inspired by this occult belief system.

---

Motte:

> Non-maleficence and beneficence are two fundamental principles in research ethics requiring the maximization of benefits and minimization of potential harms.

Another motte:

> Although the pursuit of knowledge is a fundamental public good, considerations of harm **can occasionally** supersede the goal of seeking or sharing new knowledge, and a decision not to undertake or not to publish a project **may** be warranted.

It is very important to understand that,
        although this paragraph should ring the alarm bells of any independent-minded researcher,
    the modifier words (emphasized by me) actually render it a motte, not a bailey
.
Statements like these are what make people 
        who are not explicitly suspicious of the content or motivation of the authors
    casually align with the Woke position
.

This is a common rhetorical strategy to generate a class of *Woke proximates*, 
    defined (by sceptics of the ideology) as 
    "people not trained in, or familiar with, Critical Social Justice Theory
    [that]
    adhere to, and agree with, the perspective, or at least with its prescriptions" [@Pincourt2021, p.11]
.

---

The following paragraph is neither a motte nor a bailey,
        but states a series of facts,
    ending in a veiled but existential threat
        to past and future contributing researchers
        -- the core message of the editorial (emphasized by me):

> Consideration of risks and benefits (above and beyond any institutional ethics review) underlies the editorial process of all forms of scholarly communication in our publications. Editors consider harms that might result from the publication of a piece of scholarly communication, may seek external guidance on such potential risks of harm as part of the editorial process, and in cases of **substantial risk of harm that outweighs any potential benefits**, may **decline publication (or correct, retract, remove or otherwise amend already published content)**.

This paragraph is where the integrity and trustworthiness of the journal falls to shambles
    as the editors essentially promise despotism and gatekeeping on purely subjective grounds.


### Section: "Research on human populations (including reporting standards)"

What follows are the descriptions of more or less clear tripwires
    that are laid out for the contributing researchers
.
The tripwires are defined vaguely enough that
    they could serve as an excuse to reject a publication on formal grounds
        even though it was the content that is deemed inappropriate.

Notably:

> Finally, authors should use inclusive, respectful, non-stigmatizing language in their submitted manuscripts. 

Thanks to the "death of the author" 
    ^["The Death of the Author", Roland Barthes, 1967, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_Author> (2022-09-03)]
    declared by Postmodern literature analysis, 
    we can expect the assessment of these properties to be left entirely to the whim of the interpreters, 
        in this case of the editors of the journal.
.

---

> editors reserve the right to request modifications to (or correct or otherwise amend post-publication), and in severe cases refuse publication of (or retract post-publication):

The following censorship criteria are where 
    the authors' Critical Theory conviction finally shines through in perfect clarity (emphases by me):

> 1. Content that is **premised upon the assumption** of inherent biological, social,
>    or cultural superiority or inferiority of one human group over another based on
>    race, ethnicity, national or social origin, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, political or other beliefs, age, disease, (dis)ability, or other socially constructed or socially relevant groupings
>    (hereafter referred to as socially constructed or socially relevant human groupings).
>
> 2. Content that undermines — **or could reasonably be perceived to undermine** —
>    the rights and **dignities** of an individual or human group
>    on the basis of socially constructed or socially relevant human groupings.
>
> 3. Content that includes text or images
>    that directly or indirectly **disparage a person or group**
>    on the basis of socially constructed or socially relevant human groupings.
>
> 4. Submissions that embody **singular, privileged perspectives**,
>    which are **exclusionary of a diversity** of voices
>    in relation to socially constructed or socially relevant human groupings,
>    and which **purport such perspectives to be generalisable and/or assumed**.

Here, most notably,
    the authors pre-determine and pre-constrain the conclusions and findings of the contributing researchers
.
In other words, the journal now decides what is right and what is wrong (at least to some degree)
    and contributors are only allowed to support the claims,
        not refute them
.
This is clearly an authoritarian (moralist) intrusion into the scientific process,
    and thus another blow to the trustworthiness of the journal
        and, 
            by extension,
        to the contributing researchers
.

---

The editorial finishes on some paragraphs on 
    "race, ethnicity and racism", 
    and "sex, gender (identity/presentation), and sexual orientation"
    continue in this authoritarian manner
.
Concepts of race, ancestry, ethnic identity, sex, gender, gender identity, gender presentations, and sexuality are delineated and declared "biological construct" or "sociopolitical construct" respectively
.
It is made clear that these definitions are hereby immutable and thus out of scope for research -- per decree
.


## Conclusion

*Nature Human Behaviour*, 
        and by extension *Nature*, 
    has caved to Woke ideologues.
I delivered a careful dissection and analysis of the linguistic confusions employed by this piece, 
    along with references to related work
.

Under the disguise of ethics and Motte-and-Bailey rhetoric,
    the editors state that 
        they intend to filter past and future publications by very specific (and arbitrary) moral criteria
            that hardly deserve to be called "ethics"
.
For these criteria are so vague that 
        the editorial process is effectively rendered arbitrary.
It is not made clear how mere quality and scientific rigor can save a publication when 
    its content opposes the journal's moral despotism
.

The line of arguments drawn by the authors is a staggering showcase of 
    how appealing to goodwill and humanity is misused for political purposes of Woke ideologues
    whose actual goals, 
        absent of any evidence to the contrary (except for symbolic commitments),
    should not be assumed to align with their alleged intents
.

In full clarity stands another example for how the perpetuation of Woke delusions serve as a tool to accumulate power and control.

Until this very editorial is officially retracted, 
    past and future publications in *Nature Human Behaviour*,
        even just the very fact of their continued listing,
    should be seen as a function of the corrupted editorial process,
        and should thus be interpreted with suspicion
.

The following questions about the journal's publications are provoked from now on:

- Why have publications been accepted or retained?
- Have they been altered pre- or post-publication?
- If so, who altered them?
- And for what purpose?

The last and most important question is actually answered by the editors themselves,
    implicitly and explicitly:
        for the purpose of advancing the political goals 
            of the ideology of *Critical Constructivism*, 
                the religion of the Woke
.

As such, 
    the capture of *Nature* by Postmodern nihilism
        should be seen as completed,
    and the corruption of our academic institutions should be seen as critically (and Critically) advanced
.

If you still put unconditional trust in institutions of these kinds, 
    your thinking is based on incomplete or inaccurate knowledge about the world
.
