## Introduction

*Nature Human Behaviour* is a sub-journal of *Nature* that 

> publishes research [...] into any aspect of individual or collective human behaviour.
> [@NatureHumanBehaviour2022b]

Its self-declared mission is 

> to strengthen the reach and impact of human behaviour research in directly addressing our most pressing social challenges.
> [@NatureHumanBehaviour2022b]

For this aim, it draws publications from social sciences, natural sciences, life sciences and culture studies.

The editors of the journal published the following editorial 
    on August 18, 2022:

<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01443-2>
[@NatureHumanBehaviour2022]

In this editorial, 
    the editors of *Nature* and *Nature Human Behaviour* announce and defend 
        the "development of new guidance" for research ethics
.
Said guidance defends
    the future and retroactive censoring of scientific publications
    according to the updated "ethical" guidelines of the journal,
    clearly serving the dogma of *Critical Constructivism*
        ^[Also called *Critical Social Justice* or *Wokism* for short.],
    [@Lindsay2022CriticalTheory]
.

The following is a series of motte-and-bailey pairs the editorial
    with some clarifications and contextualisation of the claims being made
        to explain their role within the broader ideology
.
I shall thus provide evidence for the claim that *Nature*,
        (as most of the academy and its institutions),
    has fallen prey to the religious fanaticism of Woke
        [@Lindsay2022Woke]
    political activists
        and should no longer be trusted as a platform for any scientific work
            by any self-respecting scientist.


## Overview of the editorial

The overarching point of the editorial is that
    scientific work must be constrained and censored
    according to its potential effects on 
            -- what the editors call -- 
        "dignity and rights".
Much of the editorial is concerned with
        hiding this controversial statement under a set of *mottes*,
            i.e. truisms and matters of course that are easy to defend
.

The main line of the argument 
    is based on a seductive fallacy:
The authors blur the line between 
    the impact of scientific work 
        on the concrete participants of experiments
    and 
        on the general group of people about whom the experiments aims to derive insights
.

For instance,
    an experiment may aim to cast light on the question of 
        how sex correlates with the ability to manipulate imaginary spatial objects in the mind
.
While there are actual participants in a corresponding experiment,
        likely unharmed,
    the authors of the editors claim that
            there is potential harm effected onto persons of one or either of the sexes,
        and that
            this potential harm should inform the decision 
                whether the results should be published
                (and by extension, whether the research should be conducted in the first place)
.

In short, the authors map properties of
        **objective verifiable harm** 
            with known external causes
    to
        **subjective potential harm**
            caused or modulated by misinterpretations or personal neuroses
.
This mapping is dishonestly framed as 
    "direct harm" versus "indirect harm"
.
This fallacious mapping forms the basis of the article's bailey argument,
Thus,
    intentionality on behalf of the authors should be assumed.


## Setting up the *motte*

In the very first sentence,
    the authors introduce a truism:

> Although academic freedom is fundamental, it is not unbounded. 

It is hard to disagree with this statement.
Of course, some academic endeavours cannot be allowed.
For instance,
    one can come up with an endless amount of obviously unethical medical experiments.

So what is the point of stating and idea
    that no one could sensibly disagree with?

Truisms are often used by Critical Social Justice Activists to back up claims that are much harder to defend.
This rhetorical move is known as a *Motte-and-Bailey* move
[@Shackel2005]
,
a particular trick of sophist confusion intended to convince someone of a controversial idea without delivering valid arguments.

A *motte* is a fortified tower 
    from which its vulnerable *bailey* (the unfortified area around it) is defended against attackers.
Analogously, a *motte argument* is an easy-to-defend argument (e.g. a truism)
    that serves as a retreat for when the *bailey argument*,
        a controversial -- often plainly false -- and thus vulnerable claim is attacked by valid criticism.

For instance,
    a claim for total government surveillance of private communications 
        invites obvious criticism regarding its effects on the freedom of speech.
A safe retreat against attacks on this claim could be
    the assertion that the protection of vulnerable groups requires effective strategies,
    or just stressing the general importance of public safety.

It is important to notice that just because an argument is delivered via a *Motte-and-Bailey* move,
    it does not necessarily mean that the argument is invalid.
However, arguments that are well-fortified with valid reasons do not require a *motte* backup.
Therefore, *Motte-and-Bailey* moves can usually be assumed to hide the controversial nature of an idea.

As we will see,
    the ideas stated in this editorial are of such a nature.
And as expected, *mottes* are used throughout to hide them.

## Mottes & Baileys of each section 

The following excerpts are given in chronological order.

I left out those content from the original article 
    that I deemed irrelevant or fluff
.
There is quite some of that
.


### Section: Introduction 

> For example, research **may** — inadvertently — stigmatize individuals or human groups. It **may** be discriminatory, racist, sexist, ableist or homophobic. It **may** provide justification for undermining the human rights of specific groups, simply because of their social characteristics.

Note 1: Modifier "may" (my emphasis) softens what would otherwise be a bailey.

Note 2: the various facets of bigotry listed 
    have long been overloaded by the Woke with various contradictory meanings
.
Hence, in this context, they are left shamefully underspecified
.
Likely intentionally, serving the motte.

---

Motte:

> In this guidance, we urge authors to be respectful of the dignity and rights of the human groups they study.

Bailey:

> We encourage researchers to consider the potential implications of research on human groups defined on the basis of social characteristics; to be reflective of their authorial perspective if not part of the group under study;

See also: Standpoint Epistomology.

Motte:

> and to contextualise their findings to minimize as much as possible potential misuse or risks of harm to the studied groups in the public sphere. We also highlight the importance of respectful, non-stigmatizing language to avoid perpetuating stereotypes and causing harm to individuals and groups.

Noteable: A bailey wrapped in two mottes form this paragraph.

---

Motte: 

> Advancing knowledge and understanding is a fundamental public good. **In some cases**, however, potential harms to the populations studied **may** outweigh the benefit of publication.

Note: The motte'ing modifiers "in some cases" and "may" 
    without which the second sentence would be clear bailey.

Bailey:

> Academic content that undermines the dignity or rights of specific groups; assumes that a human group is superior or inferior over another simply because of a social characteristic; includes hate speech or denigrating images; or promotes privileged, exclusionary perspectives raises ethics concerns that may require revisions or supersede the value of publication.

---

Motte/Bailey:

> There is a fine balance between academic freedom and the protection of the dignity and rights of individuals and human groups.

Note: A "why not" statement. 
It is unclear what a "fine balance" is, so there is still a soft controversial aspect to this statement.

Bailey:

> Ensuring that ethically conducted research on individual differences and differences among human groups flourishes, and no research is discouraged simply because it may be socially or academically controversial, is as important as preventing harm.

Note: Controversial when taking their new subjective and underspecified definition of "harm" into account.

Bailey:

> Science has for too long been **complicit** in **perpetuating** **structural inequalities** and **discrimination** in society.

Note: "for too long" is the bailey part.
Else, this statement is finished with Woke crossover words (my emphasis), forming the motte.

It is actually surprising they would end the introduction on a high Woke note.
I would have expected them to finish with a clear motte.

### Section: Principles of scholarly freedom and scholarly responsibility

This sections serves to deliver just a single large motte:

> Researchers should be free to pursue lines of inquiry and the communication of knowledge and ideas without fear of repression or censorship. At the same time, they have the ethical obligation to uphold intellectual integrity and **avoid** preventable harms that may arise in the course of research or its communication.

Note: Modifier "avoid" (emphasis by me) renders the following statement hard to argue with.

### Section: Benefits and harms of research

Motte:

> Research should respect the dignity and rights of human research participants; of individuals or groups connected either with the research participants or the research topic; and of the communities in which research is carried out. Research should also respect the rights of non-human life, tangible and intangible heritage, natural resources, and the environment.

Arguing against basic "respect" is well an uphill battle,
    though it left unspecified how that respect would manifest in the actual research.

Let's see if this clears up.

---

Motte:

> Harms can arise as a direct result of the conduct of research — for instance, injury to human participants in the course of participating in a research project; unnecessary suffering of non-human animals as a result of experimentation; material compromise of tangible heritage; ecosystem disruption etc. 

Bailey:

> Harms can also arise indirectly, as a result of the publication of a research project or a piece of scholarly communication – for instance, stigmatization of a vulnerable human group or potential use of the results of research for unintended purposes (e.g., public policies that undermine human rights or misuse of information to threaten public health).

This motte-and-bailey pair is 
    the heart of the editorial's argument.
The editors frame the dichotomy of "harms" as "direct" vs "indirect",
    which is intellectually dishonest at best
    as it distracts from their more relevant features:
As they themselves extrinsically define these two concepts,
        the motte "harm" is **objective** and **verifiable** (has manifested or will definitely manifest),
    while
        the bailey "harm" is **subjective** and **potential** (may manifest),
            including a misinterpretation ("misuse") of the work
.

As interpretations go, 
    they have a substantial subjective component to them,
    making the prediction of an interpretation
        (never mind a *possible* one)
    highly speculative.
.
This is where the authors prepare the reader to
    accept their estimation of the likelihood of an "indirect harm"
.

Along similar lines, 
    the US *Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency* recently defined
        *malinformation* as "based on fact, but used out of context to mislead, harm, or manipulate"
.
    ^["Mis, Dis, Malinformation", <https://www.cisa.gov/mdm> (2022-08-29)]
This definition is officially used to identify speech as criminal (or worse, terroristic)
    and should thus be assumed to feed into censorship programmes
.

---

Motte:

> Non-maleficence and beneficence are two fundamental principles in research ethics requiring the maximization of benefits and minimization of potential harms.

Another motte:

> Although the pursuit of knowledge is a fundamental public good, considerations of harm **can occasionally** supersede the goal of seeking or sharing new knowledge, and a decision not to undertake or not to publish a project **may** be warranted.

It is very important to understand that,
        although this paragraph should ring the alarm bells of any independent-minded researcher,
    the modifier words (emphasized by me) actually render it a motte, not a bailey
.
Statements like these are what make people 
        who are not explicitly suspicious of the content or motivation of the authors
    casually align with the Woke position
.
This is a common rhetorical strategy
.

The following paragraph is neither a motte nor a bailey,
        but states a series of facts,
    ending in a veiled but existential threat
        to past and future contributing researchers
        -- the core message of the editorial (emphasized by me):

> Consideration of risks and benefits (above and beyond any institutional ethics review) underlies the editorial process of all forms of scholarly communication in our publications. Editors consider harms that might result from the publication of a piece of scholarly communication, may seek external guidance on such potential risks of harm as part of the editorial process, and in cases of **substantial risk of harm that outweighs any potential benefits**, may **decline publication (or correct, retract, remove or otherwise amend already published content)**.

This paragraph is where the integrity and trustworthiness of the journal falls to shambles
    as the editors essentially promise despotism and gatekeeping on purely subjective grounds.


### Section: Research on human populations (including reporting standards)

What follows are the descriptions of more or less clear tripwires
    that are laid out for the contributing researchers
.
The tripwires are defined vaguely enough that
    they could serve as an excuse to reject a publication on formal grounds
        even though it was the content that is deemed inappropriate.

Notably:

> Finally, authors should use inclusive, respectful, non-stigmatizing language in their submitted manuscripts. 

Thanks to the "death of the author" 
    ^["The Death of the Author", Roland Barthes, 1967, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_Author> (2022-09-03)]
    in postmodern literature analysis, 
    we can expect the assessment of these properties to be left to the whim of the interpreters
.

---

> editors reserve the right to request modifications to (or correct or otherwise amend post-publication), and in severe cases refuse publication of (or retract post-publication):

The following censorship criteria are where 
    the authors' Critical Theory conviction finally shines through in perfect clarity (emphases by me):

> 1. Content that is **premised upon the assumption** of inherent biological, social,
>    or cultural superiority or inferiority of one human group over another based on
>    race, ethnicity, national or social origin, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, political or other beliefs, age, disease, (dis)ability, or other socially constructed or socially relevant groupings
>    (hereafter referred to as socially constructed or socially relevant human groupings).
>
> 2. Content that undermines — **or could reasonably be perceived to undermine** —
>    the rights and **dignities** of an individual or human group
>    on the basis of socially constructed or socially relevant human groupings.
>
> 3. Content that includes text or images
>    that directly or indirectly **disparage a person or group**
>    on the basis of socially constructed or socially relevant human groupings.
>
> 4. Submissions that embody **singular, privileged perspectives**,
>    which are **exclusionary of a diversity** of voices
>    in relation to socially constructed or socially relevant human groupings,
>    and which **purport such perspectives to be generalisable and/or assumed**.

Here, most notably,
    the authors pre-determine and pre-constrain the conclusions and findings of the contributing researchers
.
In other words, the journal now decides what is right and what is wrong (at least to some degree)
    and contributors are only allowed to support the claims,
        not refute them
.
This is clearly an authoritarian (moralist) intrusion into the scientific process,
    and thus another blow to the trustworthiness of the journal
        and, 
            by extension,
        to the contributing researchers
.

---

The editorial finishes on some paragraphs on 
    "race, ethnicity and racism", 
    and "sex, gender (identity/presentation), and sexual orientation"
    continue in this authoritarian and hubristic manner
.
The authors even provide a list of definitions for terms (rather concepts) 
    that are now declared immutable and thus out of scope for research -- per decree
.


## Conclusion

*Nature Human Behaviour*, 
        and by extension *Nature*, 
    has caved to ideologues of the *Critical Social Justice* strain.

Under the disguise of ethics and Motte-and-Bailey rhetoric,
    the editors state that 
        they intend to filter past and future publications by certain moral criteria
            that hardly deserve to be called "ethics"
.
For these criteria are so vague that 
        the editorial process is effectively rendered arbitrary.
It is not made clear how mere quality and scientific rigor can save a publication when 
    its content opposes the moral intuitions of the journal's editors
.

The line of arguments drawn by the authors is a staggering showcase of 
    how appealing to goodwill and humanity is misused for political purposes of Critical Social Justice ideologues
    whose actual goals, 
        absent of any evidence to the contrary (except for symbolic commitments),
    should not be assumed to align with their alleged intents
.

Until this very editorial is officially retracted, 
    past and future publications in *Nature Human Behaviour*,
        even just the very fact of their continued listing,
    should be seen as a function of the corrupted editorial process,
        and should thus be interpreted with suspicion
.

These questions about the journal's publications provoked from now on:

- Why have publications been accepted or retained?
- Have they been altered pre- or post-publication?
- If so, who altered them?
- And for what purpose?

The last and most important question is actually answered by the editors themselves:
    for the purpose of advancing the political goals 
        of the ideology of *Critical Constructivism*
.

As such, 
    the capture of *Nature* by postmodernist nihilism and anti-enlightenment activism
        should be seen as completed
.
