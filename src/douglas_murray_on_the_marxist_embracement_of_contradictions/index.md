WORK IN PROGRESS

## Introduction

The following is an excerpt from 
    the chapter *The Marxist Foundations of Intersectionality* 
    in Douglas Murray's *The Madness of Crowds: Gender, Race and Identity* 
    [@Murray2019, p.51ff.]
.
The section is a particularly poignant and succinct description of one of the core features
    of Marxist thought:
        the **embracement of contradictions**
.

To support this claim,
    an open-ended set 
        of 
            formalized steel-manned examples of Neo-Marxist syntheses 
    is provided
.

I will update this set periodically, 
    as well as its references
.

*Note on references*: I try to refer to original literature where I can (and when I have time), 
but almost all Marxist (Critical Theory) and especially Postmodern literature is notoriously difficult to read and quote,
not the least due to their constant overloading of common sense terms
.
Often, I could just as well quote a piece of extraterrestial language
.
Thus, references themselves actually require careful explanations and contextualizations
because they do not mean what reasonable people think it means
.
It is easier to refer to second-hand literature written by sceptics of the ideology,
    of course given the assumption that the reader shares my trust in their intellectual integrity and in the correctness of their derivations and summaries
.

## Marxist nonsense is a political device

Murray retells the story of the Neo-Marxist [@Lindsay2022NeoMarxism] discovery 
    of 
        new "useful" groups of people that
            are to supplement (or replace) the classic Marxist working class
                as a source of revolutionary energy 
[@Murray2019, p.56ff.]
.
These groups would include but not be limited to 
    women as well as ethnic, national and sexual minorities
[@Murray2019, p.58]
.

Neo-Marxist victim groups are obviously at tension with each other in terms of alleged victimhood,
    at least partially
.
For example,
    the working class is assumed to be "racist" by nature
        [@Murray2019, p.58]
    and the cultural backgrounds 
        of 
            many ethnic minorities (e.g. Muslims) 
        are not exactly known for their liberal stance on the equality of men and women
.
Another challenge derived from the desire to explain "oppression" as the result 
    of both
        systemic misattribution of **fixedness on fluidity** (e.g. sex and race)
    on the one hand, 
    and on
        systemic misattribution of **fluidity on fixedness** (e.g. sexuality)
    on the other hand
[@Murray2019, p.58]
.

This would imply anything but a *grand simple non-contradictory unifying theory of oppression*,
    unless of course the rhetoric alchemy of the Hegelian dialectic would be utilized
.

Murray writes:

> One of the traits of Marxist thinkers has always been that
>   they do not stumble or self-question in the face of contradiction,
>   as anybody aiming at truth might.
> **Marxists have always rushed towards contradiction.**
> The Hegelian dialectic only advances by means of contradiction and therefore all the complexities 
>   -- one might say absurdities --
> met along the way are welcomed and almost embraced as though they were helpful,
>   rather than troubling,

> [@Murray2019, p.58]

(My emphasis.)

Murray warns against believing that self-destruction of the ideology would necessarily follow:

> Anybody hoping that intersectionality would dissolve amid its own inherent contradictions
> cannot have seen the myriad of contradictions
> a Marxist can hold in their head at any one time.
> [@Murray2019, p.58]

The ubiquity of incommensurate beliefs applies to the political cult descendants of the Marxist ur-religion as well
-- and it seems to cause no discomfort:

> Their ideological children in identity politics and intersectionality seem content to inhabit an ideological space
> littered with **contradiction**, **absurdity** and **hypocrisy**.
> [@Murray2019, p.59]

(My emphasis.)

**Contradiction**, **absurdity** and **hypocrisy** 
    are not restricted 
        to 
            identity politics and intersectionality
.
In fact,
    these are the key features of all Marxist thought,
    as the Hegelian *Aufhebung* (*Synthesis*) of incongruities
        is what makes *History* *progress*,
            by definition.
.
From this (clearly esoteric) belief follows the imperative 
    to 
        seek and embrace those contradictions 
            whose *Aufhebung* serves the *Theory* of Marxist revolution
.
Within an activist paradigm, 
    this is what constitutes good *Praxis*
.

Murray expresses a lack of surprise over such **intellectualization of nonsense**
    as large parts of academia have long degenerated 
        from 
            truth-seeking 
        into 
            political activism
[@Murray2019, p.59]
.
It seems obvious that intellectual integrity has to take a back seat when political change is the goal
.
Decades of so-called social studies around "intersectionality" are just "make-believe, masquerading as science"
[@Murray2019, p.60],
making it "hard to detect what is sincere and what is satire"
[@Murray2019, p.61]
.

As laid out, none of these issues are a problem for academics of this line of sociology
.
Their conviction is the belief that any seeming contradiction is just a 
**synthesis that has not yet been compounded from the thesis and the antithesis**
(as Hegel would put it).
So which reason would a Marxist intellectual have to stop and think?
History is only ever moving forward, after all.
Contradictions between reality and the utopia are to be synthesized away.

No wonder "our societies have arrived at a stage of seemingly industrial-strength denial"
[@Murray2019, p.77]
.

## Steel-manned examples of Neo-Marxist syntheses

Syntheses are devices of Hegelian *dialectics*.

The following examples are implicated to be a consequence of *Neo-Marxist* thought.
However, being a *Neo-Marxist* is not a necessary condition 
    for
        understanding them 
    or for 
        believing in their validity
.

### "Sexy, but not sexualized"

> The impossible demand [...] is that a woman must be allowed to be as sexy and sexual as she pleases,
> but that does not mean she can be sexualized.
> **Sexy, but not sexualized**.
> [@Murray2019, 79--80]

(My emphasis.)

Thesis

:   Every woman may express her sex-appeal to any extent.

Antithesis

:   No woman must be perceived in terms of her sexuality.

Synthesis

:   ?


### Women are both the same as men and better as men

> [...] there is the [contradictory settlement] that simultaneously insists that 
> women are in every meaningful way exactly the **same as men**,
> possessing the same traits and competencies and able to challenge them on the same turf at any time.
> Yet, simultaneously, magically, they are **better than men**, or better in specific ways.
> All this seems perfectly capable of being held in the same head -- contradictory it all is.
> So that the current accepted way of regarding women is: 
> The same as men, but different where it's **useful or flattering**.
> [@Murray2019, 80]

Thesis

:   Women are the same as men in every meaningful aspect.

Antithesis

:   Women are better than men in every meaningful aspect.

Synthesis

:   Women are the same as men, but different where it's useful or flattering.
