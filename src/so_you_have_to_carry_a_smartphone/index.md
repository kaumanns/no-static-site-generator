I have been carrying an old Nokia phone.

Carrying a fancy little function phone certainly
Encrypted communication though is out of reach for these ancient devices.

So back to the smartphone I go.

Treat your smartphone as a liability.
For me that means:

- No contacts
- No calendar
- No email
- No browser profile synchronization
- No bookmarks
- No passwords
- No notes




**Keep your device in airplane mode as much of the time as possible.
Better yet: switch it off.**

I choose to disable airplane mode when I am at home so people can call/text me.

Outside, I enable airplane mode or switch off the device.
Once in a while I may enable reception for data to check Signal messages, unless I feel like I could be mis-triangulated by the reception towers in a suspicious place (which is rare fortunately).
